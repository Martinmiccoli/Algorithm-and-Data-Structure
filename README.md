# Algorithms & Data Structures for Data Science

This repository showcases the work completed during the **Algorithms & Data Structures for Data Science** course, focusing on implementing classic algorithms and exploring Python's data structures in depth. The goal was to build a strong foundation by understanding how these algorithms and structures work from the ground up.

## üìö Overview

The repository contains:  
- Development of key **sorting algorithms**, **search algorithms** from the ground up.  
- Exercises aimed at uncovering the mechanics behind Python's data structures and their associated methods.  
- Hands-on problem-solving using custom implementations, with a focus on meeting strict **time complexity requirements** and enhancing **code performance**.  


## ‚ú® Key Highlights

- **Practical Experience:** Building algorithms like sorting and searching from scratch clarifies their inner workings and core principles.  
- **Efficiency Focus:** Tackling problems within defined constraints enhances comprehension of algorithm performance and its implications in real-world scenarios.  
- **In-Depth Understanding:** Although Python provides highly optimized, ready-made solutions, implementing these structures manually unveils the complexities of their design and functionality.
